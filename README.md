# CS50
Welcome to my CS50 Folder, which currently only has my final project.

There are three known bugs / todos in MorseMachine.py
1/ It doesn't handle improper user input.
2/ It doesn't print spaces between words when decoding from morse to english
3/ UserInput is not case insensitive.

Otherwise. Works as intended. Test it out with the first Morse code ever sent by Samuel Morse: Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
